# programming_class_java-
projects for COP2210 


****** These are just files for the practice exercises in the "Big Java, 5th Edition" book that I'm using to 
********* practice. Most of these files will have alternative solutions for curiosities sake. These will usually 
************* be commented out and will therefore be non-executable. In order to get these to work, remove both the 
****************** preceding and ending "/* and */", respectively. Welcome to the show!!!!
